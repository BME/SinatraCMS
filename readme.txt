Just a simple Sinatra App. I realized that when I want to do quick, one-off applications that I love Sinatra. I also realized that I follow a lot of the same coding patterns for all my Sinatra apps that aren't just one .rb file. 

This project just encapsulates a bare bones Sinatra app that contains a few extras that are common to Sinatra
